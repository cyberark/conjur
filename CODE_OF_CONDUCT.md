# Conjur Community Code of Conduct

We are setting a new standard for how development, security, and operations
teams work together. We strive to give application developers protection from
breaches and confidence that they can code safely and deliver reliable software
fast without getting hacked.

Conjur is a piece of technology, but more importantly, it is a community.

We believe that our mission is best served in an environment that is friendly,
safe, and accepting; free from intimidation or harassment.

Towards this end, certain behaviors and practices will not be tolerated.

## tl;dr

* Be respectful.
* We're here to help: <abuse@conjur.org>
* Abusive behavior is never tolerated.
* Violations of this code may result in swift and permanent expulsion from the
  Conjur community.

## Scope

We expect all members of the Conjur community, including paid and unpaid agents,
administrators, users, and customers of CyberArk, to abide by this Code of
Conduct at all times in all Conjur community venues, online and in person, and
in one-on-one communications pertaining to Conjur affairs.

This policy covers the usage of Conjur hosted services, as well as the Conjur
website, Conjur related events, and any other services offered by or on behalf
of CyberArk. (collectively, the "Service"). It also applies to behavior in the
context of the Conjur Open Source project communities, including but not limited
to public GitHub repositories, chat channels, social media, mailing lists, and
public events.

This Code of Conduct is in addition to, and does not in any way nullify or
invalidate, any other terms or conditions related to use of the Service.

The definitions of various subjective terms such as "offensive", "harrassing",
or "unacceptable behavior" will be decided at the sole discretion of the Conjur
abuse team.

## Maintaining a Friendly, Harassment-Free Space

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for
all, regardless of gender identity, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity,
religion, age, physical appearance, body size, race, or similar personal
characteristics.

We ask that you please respect that people have differences of opinion regarding
technical choices, and that every design or implementation choice carries a
trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom a single right answer. A
difference of technology preferences is not a license to be rude.

Any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting, or other attention-stealing behavior
is not welcome, and will not be tolerated.

Harassing other users of the Service is never tolerated, whether via public or
private media.

Avoid using offensive or harassing nicknames or other identifiers that might
detract from a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all.
