# Policy Factory

Policy Factories are a mechanism for creating custom bits of Conjur Policy and corresponding Conjur secrets in support of some broader outcome, like an authenticator, database, connection, PKI infrastructure, or nearly anything you can dream up.

## Setup

The easiest way to load Policy Factories into Conjur is via:

- Internal [Cyberark Policy Factory CLI](https://github.cyberng.com/jvanderhoof/policy-factory-cli)
- External [Mirror](https://github.com/jvanderhoof/policy_factory)

The CLI provides a set of Factories as well as a DSL for writing your own Factories.

## API

All Policy Factory API endpoints require authentication and follow the existing Conjur API patterns. Policy Factories are stored in Conjur variables. Conjur Policy should be used to
limit access to particular Factories to those roles which are allowed to use them.

### List Factories

Display all available Factories a role has access to, grouped by factory classification:

```
GET /factories/<account>
```

#### Response Codes

| Code | Description |
|-|-|
| 200 | Factory resource details returned as JSON array |
| 401 | The request lacks valid authentication credentials |


### [Experimental] Circuit Breakers

Policy Factories includes a "circuit-breaker" group, which allows access to variables
or use of an authenticator to be severed. This allows a security administrator to mitigate
a data leak or security event without writing any Conjur Policy.

Factories created via the CLI (starting with version `1.0.0`) automatically include the
required policy.

*Note: enabling/disabling circuit-breakers requires `update` permission on the Factory-created
policy.*

### [Experimental] Cut Access

Removes read access to Factory variables or authenticate permission on an authenticator.

```
POST /factory-resources/<account>/<policy_identifier>/disable
```

#### Sample Request

```
POST /factory-resources/demo/my-test-policy-1%2Fproduction-1/disable
```

#### Sample Response

```json
{
    "created_roles": {},
    "version": 2
}
```

#### Response Codes

| Code | Description |
|-|-|
| 200 | Successfully disabled access |
| 401 | The request lacks valid authentication credentials |
| 403 | The request lacks permission to disable access |
| 501 | The target policy lacks a circuit-breaker group |


### [Experimental] Reenable Access

Restore read access to Factory variables or authenticate permission on an authenticator.

```
POST /factory-resources/<account>/<policy_identifier>/enable
```

#### Sample Request

```
POST /factory-resources/demo/my-test-policy-1%2Fproduction-1/enable
```

#### Sample Response

```json
{
    "created_roles": {},
    "version": 2
}
```

#### Response Codes

| Code | Description |
|-|-|
| 200 | Successfully enables access |
| 401 | The request lacks valid authentication credentials |
| 403 | The request lacks permission to enables access |
| 501 | The target policy lacks a circuit-breaker group |

### View all Policy Factories

A role is limited to viewing the Factories they have permission (`execute`) to see.
If a role can see a factory, they will be able to see errors in mis-configured Factories.
