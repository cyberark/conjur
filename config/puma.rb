# [Added Aug 8, 2018]
# With large policy files, the request can exceed the 1
# minute default worker timeout. We've increased it to
# 10 minutes as a stopgap until we determine the root
# cause and implement a permanent solution.
worker_timeout 600

# If the load balancer/proxy/server in front of Conjur has
# a longer timeout than Conjur, there will be 502s as Conjur will
# close the connection even if there are pending requests. This
# can lead to it being marked unavailable, errors returned to the
# client and performance issues as nginx/load balancer in front of it.
# Puma defaults to 20 seconds which is substantially lower than
# other service defaults
persistent_timeout 80

# Leave this as the default if deploying Conjur behind a load balancer
# or reverse proxy (eg ELB or Nginx).
#
# Puma's max_fast_inline parameter determines the number of requests that can be
# sent through a single connection, after this number of requests the connection
# is closed. This is a DoS mitigation tactic, but leads to a ~10% failure rate
# for clients sending high volumes of requests and re-using connections. If puma
# is directly publicly exposed, then setting this value low to prevent DoS by
# greedy connections could make sense.

#   infinity is reasonable behind a proxy: https://github.com/puma/puma/issues/2361#issuecomment-690332926))
