Feature: Users and groups can be added to groups

  @smoke @sanity
  Scenario: Create a group of groups
  
    In this example we are giving the `group:employees` role to groups
    `developers` and `operations`.  This effectively adds groups `developers`
    and `operations` to the `employees` group. They are granted all privileges
    of the `employees` group.
    
    Given I load a policy:
    """
    # First create the groups
    - !group employees
    - !group developers
    - !group operations
    
    # Now grant group employees to groups developers and operations
    - !grant
      role: !group employees
      members:
      - !group developers
      - !group operations
    """
    When I show the group "employees"
    Then group "developers" is a role member
    And group "operations" is a role member

  Scenario: Add an administrator to a group

    In this example, a group `ci-admin` gets an admin grant on the group `ci`.
    This means that members of the group `ci-admin` can add and remove members
    from the group `ci`. In real-world terms, everyone who uses your Jenkins
    system may be in the `ci` group. A smaller group of Jenkins admins are in
    the `ci-admin` group, and can manage who is in the `ci` group.

    Note how group `ci-admin` is aliased with the name "admin" in the policy.
    This is effectively creating a reference to that group we can use later in
    the policy. Aliasing policy records makes policies DRYer and easier to
    maintain. By using a reference, `!group ci-admin` is defined once in the
    policy and then later used by reference. Create an alias by declaring a
    name prepended with `&`. Dereference that record later on in your policy by
    using the same name prepended with a `*`. Aliasing also allows you to group
    records together under a single symbolic name.
    
    Given I load a policy:
    """
    - !group ci
    
    - !group &admin ci-admin
    
    - !grant
      role: !group ci
      member: !member 
        role: *admin
        admin: true
    """
    When I show the group "ci"
    Then group "ci-admin" is a role member with admin option
