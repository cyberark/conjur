Feature: Deleting objects and relationships.

  Objects and relationships can be explicitly deleted using the !delete,
  !revoke, and !deny statements.

  Scenario: The !delete statement can be used to delete an object.
    Given I load a policy:
    """
    - !group developers
    """
    Then group "developers" exists
    And I update the policy with:
    """
    - !delete
      record: !group developers
    """
    Then group "developers" does not exist

  @acceptance
  Scenario: Deleting variable value is unrecoverable.
    Given I load a policy:
    """
    - !policy
      id: test
      body:
      - !variable db-password
    """
    And variable "test/db-password" exists
    # Variable loaded twice so we verify we delete all of its versions
    And I can add a secret to variable resource "test/db-password"
    And I can add a secret to variable resource "test/db-password"
    And I can fetch a secret from variable resource "test/db-password"
    When I update the policy with:

    """
    - !policy

      body:
      - !variable db-password
    """
    Then variable "test/db-password" exists
    And variable resource "test/db-password" does not have a secret value

  @acceptance
  Scenario: Deleting variable value is unrecoverable even if we add same variable with the delete policy
    Given I load a policy:

  Scenario: The !revoke statement can be used to revoke a role grant.
    Given I load a policy:

    Scenario: Delete statements prevail on conflicting policy statements
