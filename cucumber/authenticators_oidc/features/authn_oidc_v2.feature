Feature: OIDC Authenticator V2 - Users can authenticate with OIDC authenticator

  In this feature we define an OIDC authenticator in policy and perform authentication
  with Conjur. In successful scenarios we will also define a variable and permit the user to
  execute it, to verify not only that the user can authenticate with the OIDC
  Authenticator, but that it can retrieve a secret using the Conjur access token.

  Background:
