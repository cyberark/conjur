Feature: OIDC Authenticator - Hosts can authenticate with OIDC authenticator

  In this feature we define an OIDC authenticator in policy and perform authentication
  with Conjur. In successful scenarios we will also define a variable and permit the host to
  execute it, to verify not only that the host can authenticate with the OIDC
  Authenticator, but that it can retrieve a secret using the Conjur access token.

  Background:
    Given the following environment variables are available:
      | context_variable            | environment_variable   | default_value                                                    |

      | oidc_client_id              | KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_ID     | conjurClient                                                     |

      | oidc_provider_uri           | PROVIDER_URI           | https://keycloak:8443/auth/realms/master                         |
      | oidc_id_token_user_property | ID_TOKEN_USER_PROPERTY | preferred_username                                               |
      | oidc_ca_cert                | KEYCLOAK_CA_CERT       |                                                                  |
