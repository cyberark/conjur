Feature: JWT Authenticator - Fetch identity from decoded token

  Tests checking the fetch of identity from JWT token using these configurations from policy:
  * 'token-app-property' - define claim in JWT token that holds the identity
  * 'identity-path' - prefix of the host connecting with JWT authenticator
