Feature: JWT Authenticator - Status Check

  Checks status API of JWT authenticator. Status API should return error on each case of misconfiguration in
  authenticator or policy that can be found before authentication request.

  Background:
    Given I initialize remote JWKS endpoint with file "authn-jwt-configuration" and alg "RS256"
