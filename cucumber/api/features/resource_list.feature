Feature: List resources with various types of filtering

  Background:
    Given I am a user named "alice"
    And I create 3 new resources

  @smoke
  Scenario: The resource list includes a new resource.

    The most basic resource listing route returns all resources in an account.

    Given I save my place in the audit log file for remote
    When I successfully GET "/resources/cucumber"
    Then the resource list should include the newest resources
    And there is an audit record matching:
    """

  Scenario: The resource list can be filtered by resource kind.
    Given I create a new "variable" resource
