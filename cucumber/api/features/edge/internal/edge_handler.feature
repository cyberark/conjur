Feature: Edge data endpoint

  Background:
    Given I clear Redis cache
    Given I create a new user "some_user"
    And I create a new user "admin_user"
    And I have host "data/some_host1"
    And I am the super-user
    And I successfully PUT "/policies/cucumber/policy/root" with body:
    """
