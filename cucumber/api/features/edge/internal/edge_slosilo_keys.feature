Feature: Fetching slosilo keys from edge endpoint

  Background:
    Given I clear Redis cache
    Given I create a new user "some_user"
    And I create a new user "admin_user"
    And I am the super-user
    When I successfully PUT "/policies/cucumber/policy/root" with body:
    """
    - !policy
      id: edge
      body:
        - !group edge-hosts
        - !group edge-installer-group
        - !policy
            id: edge-configuration
            body:
              - &edge-variables
                - !variable max-edge-allowed
    - !policy
      id: data
      body:
        - !host
              id: some_host1
              annotations:
                authn/api-key: true

    - !group Conjur_Cloud_Admins
    - !grant
      role: !group Conjur_Cloud_Admins
      member: !user admin_user
    """
    And I add the secret value "3" to the resource "cucumber:variable:edge/edge-configuration/max-edge-allowed"
    Given I login as "admin_user"
    And I set the "Content-Type" header to "application/json"
    When I POST "/edge/cucumber" with body:
      """
      {
        "edge_name": "edge_slosilo"
      }
      """
    Then the HTTP response status code is 201
    And Edge name "edge_slosilo" data exists in db
    And I clear the "Content-Type" header
    And I log out

  @acceptance
  Scenario: Fetching key when previous key is null with edge host return 200 OK with json result
    Given I login as the host associated with Edge "edge_slosilo"
    And Previous host slosilo key is null
    When I GET "/edge/slosilo_keys/cucumber"
    Then the HTTP response status code is 200
    And the JSON at "slosiloKeys" should have 1 entries
    And the JSON should have "slosiloKeys/0/fingerprint"
    And the JSON at "slosiloKeys/0/fingerprint" should be a string
    And the JSON should have "slosiloKeys/0/privateKey"
    And the JSON at "slosiloKeys/0/privateKey" should be a string
    And the JSON at "previousSlosiloKeys" should be equal to the JSON at "slosiloKeys"

  @acceptance
  Scenario: Fetching key when after key rotation with edge host return 200 OK with json result
    Given I login as the host associated with Edge "edge_slosilo"
    And Previous host slosilo key is null
    When Slosilo key is rotated
    And I GET "/edge/slosilo_keys/cucumber"
    And the JSON at "slosiloKeys" should have 1 entries
    And the JSON should have "slosiloKeys/0/fingerprint"
    And the JSON at "slosiloKeys/0/fingerprint" should be a string
    And the JSON should have "slosiloKeys/0/privateKey"
    And the JSON at "slosiloKeys/0/privateKey" should be a string
    And the JSON at "previousSlosiloKeys" should have 1 entries
    And the JSON at "previousSlosiloKeys/0/fingerprint" should be a string
    And the JSON should have "previousSlosiloKeys/0/privateKey"
    And the JSON at "previousSlosiloKeys/0/privateKey" should be a string
    Then the JSON at "previousSlosiloKeys" should not be equal to the JSON at "slosiloKeys"

  Scenario: Fetching hosts with non edge host return 403
    Given I login as "some_user"
    When I GET "/edge/slosilo_keys/cucumber"
    Then the HTTP response status code is 403
    Given I login as "host/data/some_host1"
