Feature: Manage the role entitlements through the API

  As an affordance for users to manage the entitlements for group membership,
  there are two API endpoints for granting and revoking role membership.

  Background:
    Given I clear Redis cache
    Given I am the super-user
    And I successfully PUT "/policies/cucumber/policy/root" with body:
    """
    - !user alice
    - !user bob
    - !user charlie

    - !policy
      id: dev
      body:
      - !group developers

    - !grant
      role: !group dev/developers
      member: !user alice

    - !permit
      resource: !policy root
      privileges: [ create, update ]
      roles: !user alice

    - !permit
      resource: !group dev/developers
      privileges: [ read ]
      roles: !user alice

    - !permit
      resource: !group dev/developers
      privileges: [ read ]
      roles: !user charlie
    """

  Scenario: Add a group membership through the API
    Given I save my place in the audit log file for remote
    When I successfully POST "/roles/cucumber/group/dev%2Fdevelopers?members&member=cucumber:user:bob"
    And I successfully GET "/roles/cucumber/group/dev%2Fdevelopers"
    Then the JSON at "members" should be:
    """
