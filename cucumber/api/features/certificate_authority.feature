  @negative @acceptance
  Scenario: A non-existent ca returns a 404
    When I POST "/ca/cucumber/living-room/sign"
    Then the HTTP response status code is 404

  @negative @acceptance
  Scenario: A login that isn't a host returns a 403
    When I POST "/ca/cucumber/kitchen/sign"
    Then the HTTP response status code is 403

  @negative @acceptance
  Scenario: The service returns 403 Forbidden if the host doesn't have sign privileges
    Given I login as "cucumber:host:toast"
    When I send a CSR for "toast" to the "kitchen" CA with a ttl of "P6M" and CN of "toast"
    Then the HTTP response status code is 403

  Scenario: I can sign a valid CSR with a configured Conjur CA
    Given I login as "cucumber:host:bacon"
    When I send a CSR for "bacon" to the "kitchen" CA with a ttl of "P6M" and CN of "bacon"
    Then the HTTP response status code is 201
    And the HTTP response content type is "application/json"
    And the resulting json certificate is valid according to the "kitchen" intermediate CA

  @acceptance
  Scenario: I can receive the result directly as a PEM formatted certificate
    Given I login as "cucumber:host:bacon"
    And I set the "Accept" header to "application/x-pem-file"
    When I send a CSR for "bacon" to the "kitchen" CA with a ttl of "P6M" and CN of "bacon"
    Then the HTTP response status code is 201
    And the HTTP response content type is "application/x-pem-file"
    And the resulting pem certificate is valid according to the "kitchen" intermediate CA
    And the common name is "cucumber:kitchen:host:bacon"
    And the subject alternative names contain "DNS:bacon"
    And the subject alternative names contain "URI:spiffe://conjur/cucumber/kitchen/host/bacon"

  @acceptance
  Scenario: I can sign a CSR using an encrypted CA private key
    Given I login as "cucumber:host:table"
    When I send a CSR for "table" to the "dining-room" CA with a ttl of "P6M" and CN of "table"
    Then the HTTP response status code is 201
    And the HTTP response content type is "application/json; charset=utf-8"
    And the resulting json certificate is valid according to the "dining-room" intermediate CA
