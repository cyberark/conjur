Feature: Exchange a role's password for its API key

  Roles which have passwords can use the `login` method to obtain their API key.
  The API key is then used to authenticate and receive an auth token.

  Background:
    Given I create a new user "alice"
    And I have host "app"

  Scenario: Password can be used to obtain API key
    Given I set the password for "alice" to "My-Password1"
    And I save my place in the audit log file for remote
    When I can GET "/authn/cucumber/login" with username "alice" and password "My-Password1"
    Then the HTTP response content type is "text/plain"
    And the result is the API key for user "alice"
    And there is an audit record matching:
