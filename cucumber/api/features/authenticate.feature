Feature: Exchange a role's API key for a signed authentication token

  A role's API key can be used to obtain a signed authentication token.

  The token is a signed JSON structure that contains the role id. The
  token can be sent as the `Authorization` header to other Conjur REST
  functions as proof of authentication.
  Background:
    Given I create a new user "alice"
    And I have host "app"
    And I have host "appNoApiKey" without api key
