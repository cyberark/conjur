Feature: RBAC privileges control whether a role can update and/or fetch a secret.

  Background:
    Given I create a new user "bob"
    And I create a new "variable" resource called "probe"
    And I permit user "bob" to "read" it
    And I create 1 secret values

  @negative @acceptance
  Scenario: Fetching a secret as an unauthorized user results in a 403 error.

    Given I login as "bob"
    Given I save my place in the audit log file for remote
    When I GET "/secrets/cucumber/:resource_kind/:resource_id"
    Then the HTTP response status code is 403
    And there is an audit record matching:
    """
      <84>1 * * conjur * fetch
      [auth@43868 user="cucumber:user:bob"]

  @acceptance
  Scenario: A foreign role can be granted permission to fetch a secret.

    The `execute` privilege can be granted to any role to allow it to fetch a secret.

    Given I permit user "bob" to "execute" it
    And I login as "bob"
    Then I can GET "/secrets/cucumber/:resource_kind/:resource_id"

  @acceptance
  Scenario: A foreign role can be granted permission to update a secret.

    The `update` privilege can be granted to any role to allow it to update a secret.

  @negative @acceptance
  Scenario: Fetching a secret without any permission on it
    If the user doesn't have any permission or ownership of a secret, fetching
    it should return 404 (not 403) even if it exists.

    Given I create a new user "alice"
    And I login as "alice"
