Feature: Rotate a host api key using the host factory.

  Background:
    Given I am the super-user
    And I successfully PUT "/policies/cucumber/policy/root" with body:
    """
    - !policy

    And I create a host factory token for "database/users"
    And I authorize the request with the host factory token

  @negative @acceptance
  Scenario: The host factory cannot rotate the host api key that previously existed

    If a host role already exists, but there is no corresponding resource to check,
    the host builder will now return 403 forbidden because we cannot verify ownership.
