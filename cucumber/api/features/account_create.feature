Feature: Create a new account

  Conjur supports multiple accounts in a single database. Each account is a
  separate "tenant" with its own set of data.

  Importantly, each account also uses its own token-signing key, so that tokens
  created by one account won't be accepted by a different account.

  Accounts are managed through a standard REST interface.  The "accounts" routes
  are authorized via privileges on the resource "!:webservice:accounts".

  Scenario: POST /accounts to create a new account.

    "execute" privilege on "!:webservice:accounts" is required.

    The response is JSON which contains:

    1. **id** The account id.
    2. **api_key** The API key of the account "admin" user.

    # Note: "!" is the default account
    Given I create a new user "admin" in account "!"
    And I permit role "!:user:admin" to "execute" resource "!:webservice:accounts"
    And I login as "!:user:admin"
    Then I successfully POST "/accounts" with body:
    """
    id=new-account
    """
    And the JSON should have "id"
    And the JSON should have "api_key"

  Scenario: POST /accounts requires "execute" privilege.

    Without "execute" privilege the request is forbidden.

    When I POST "/accounts" with body:
    """
    {
      id: new-account
    }
    """
    Then the HTTP response status code is 403
    And the result is empty
