@api
Feature: Loading big policies

  The API can be used to load large policies

  Background:
    Given I clear Redis cache

  @acceptance
  Scenario: I load a policy with 1k users, 1k groups
    Given I am the super-user
    Then I can PUT "/policies/cucumber/policy/root" with body from file "1k-users-1k-groups.yml"
