Feature: Adding and fetching secrets

  Each resource in Conjur has an associated list of "secrets", each of which is
  an arbitrary piece of encrypted data. Access to secrets is governed by
  privileges:

  - **execute** permission to fetch the value of a secret
  - **update** permission to change the value of a secret

  The list of secrets on a resource is appended when a new secret value is
  added. The list is capped to the last 20 secret values in order to limit the
  size of the backend database.

  Secrets are encrypted using AES-256-GCM.

  Background:
    Given I clear Redis cache
    Given I am a user named "eve"
    Given I create a new "variable" resource called "probe"

  @negative @acceptance
  Scenario: Update a secret for a resource with no permissions

    When I am a user named "alice"
    When I POST "/secrets/cucumber/variable/probe" with body:
    """
    v-1
    """
    Then the HTTP response status code is 404

  @negative @acceptance
  Scenario: Fetching a resource with no name provided return a 404 error.

    When I GET "/secrets/cucumber/variable/"
    Then the HTTP response status code is 404

  @negative @acceptance
  Scenario: Fetching a resource with no secret values return a 404 error.

    When I GET "/secrets/cucumber/variable/probe"
    Then the HTTP response status code is 404
    And there is an error
    And the error message is "CONJ00076E Variable cucumber:variable:probe is empty or not found."

  @negative @acceptance
  Scenario: Fetching a secret for a nonexistent resource

    When I GET "/secrets/cucumber/variable/non-existent"
    Then the HTTP response status code is 404
    And there is an error
    And the error message is "CONJ00076E Variable cucumber:variable:non-existent is empty or not found."

  @negative @acceptance
  Scenario: Update a secret of a nonexistent resource

    When I POST "/secrets/cucumber/variable/non-existent" with body:
    """
    v-1

  Scenario: Fetching a secret for a resource with no permissions

    When I POST "/secrets/cucumber/variable/probe" with body:

    And I am a user named "alice"
    And I GET "/secrets/cucumber/variable/probe"
    Then the HTTP response status code is 404

  @acceptance
  Scenario: The 'conjur/mime_type' annotation is used in the value response.

  If the annotation `conjur/mime_type` exists on a resource, then when a
  secret value is fetched from the resource, that mime type is used as the
  `Content-Type` header in the response.

    Given I set annotation "conjur/mime_type" to "application/json"
    And I save my place in the audit log file for remote
    When I successfully POST "/secrets/cucumber/variable/probe" with body:
    """
    [ "v-1" ]
    """
    Then there is an audit record matching:
    """

  @acceptance
  Scenario: Secrets can contain any binary data.

    Given I create a binary secret value
    When I successfully GET "/secrets/cucumber/variable/probe"
    Then the binary result is preserved

  Scenario: The last secret is the default one returned.

  Adding a new secret appends to a list of values on the resource. When
  retrieving secrets, the last value in the list is returned by default.

    """
    v-1
