Feature: GCP Authenticator - GCE flow, hosts can authenticate with GCP authenticator

  In this feature we define a GCP authenticator in policy and perform authentication
  with Conjur.
  In successful scenarios we will also define a variable and permit the host to
  execute it, to verify not only that the host can authenticate with the GCP
  Authenticator, but that it can retrieve a secret using the Conjur access token.

  Background:
