Feature: Azure Authenticator - Different Hosts can authenticate with Azure authenticator

  In this feature we define an Azure authenticator in policy, define different
  hosts and perform authentication with Conjur.

  Background:
    Given I load a policy:
    """
    - !policy
      id: conjur/authn-azure/prod
      body:
      - !webservice

      - !variable
        id: provider-uri

      - !group apps

      - !permit
        role: !group apps
        privilege: [ read, authenticate ]
        resource: !webservice
    """
    And I am the super-user
    And I successfully set Azure provider-uri variable with the correct values
