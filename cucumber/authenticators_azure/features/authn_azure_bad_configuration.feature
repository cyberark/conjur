Feature: Azure Authenticator - Bad authenticator configuration leads to an error

  In this feature we define an Azure Authenticator with a configuration
  mistake. Each test will verify that we fail the authentication in such a case
  and log the relevant error for the user to re-configure the authenticator
  properly
