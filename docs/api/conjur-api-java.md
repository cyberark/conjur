The [Conjur Java API](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur-api-java) provides a
robust programmatic interface for talking to a Conjur server from within your
Java project. You can use the Java API to authenticate with Conjur and fetch
secrets in a secure manner. Integration with Conjur provides a variety of
additional benefits including being able to store security policy as code, and automated secret rotation.
