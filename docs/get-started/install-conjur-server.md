A Conjur Community Edition server is running in the cloud for you, so you do not need to install a server to evaluate its features.
Your account login details for the cloud server were emailed to you when you signed up to evaluate Conjur.

In the near future, the Conjur server will be available for download and running on-premise. Please contact support with questions, or for assistance with the cloud server.
