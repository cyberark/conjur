### Changed
- OIDC based authenticators no longer return Bad Gateway and Gateway Timeout http error codes.
  Unauthorised is returned instead.
  [cyberark/conjur#2360](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/pull/2360)

## [1.13.0] - 2021-07-29

### Added
- Added enforced claims support to JWT generic vendor configuration. [cyberark/conjur#2325](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/pull/2325)
- Added claims mapping support to JWT generic vendor configuration. [cyberark/conjur#2330](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/pull/2330)
- Added audience check to JWT generic vendor configuration. [cyberark/conjur#2345](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/pull/2345)

### Security
- Bump `cyberark/ubi-ruby-fips` from 1.0.3 to 1.0.4 to address CVE-2021-33910.
  [cyberark/conjur#2333](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/2333)
- Upgraded addressable in ./Gemfile.lock and ./docs/Gemfile.lock to 2.8.0 to resolve
  GHSA-jxhc-q857-3j6g [cyberark/conjur#2311](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/pull/2311)
- Previously, OIDC authentication requests that included a user ID in the URL
  path would return a Conjur access token without requiring a valid OIDC token
  in the request. OIDC authentication requests that attempt to include a user ID
  in the URL path now return a `404 Not Found` response.
  [Security Bulletin](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/security/advisories/GHSA-6xj8-59gr-4jp3)

## [1.12.0] - 2021-06-25

### Added
- The JWT Authenticator (`authn-jwt`) supports authenticating third-party vendors that utilize JWT.
  See [design](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/blob/master/design/authenticators/authn_jwt/authn_jwt_solution_design.md)
- Set MAX_REQUESTS_PER_CONNECTION to infinity and introduced an
  environment variable to allow users to set their own value,
  see PR for further information:
  [cyberark/conjur#2282](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/2282)

### Changed
- Parsing a Conjur config with invalid YAML content now outputs a more user
  friendly error message without a stack trace.
  [cyberark/conjur#2256](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/2256)
- Set the Puma process explicitly to reliably restart the correct process
  when the Conjur configuration is reloaded.
  [cyberark/conjur#2291](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/pull/2291)

### Security
- Upgrade bindata to 2.4.10 to resolve Unspecified Issue reported by JFrog Xray
  [cyberark/conjur#2257](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/2257)

## [1.11.7] - 2021-06-08

### Added

  the CONJUR_TRUSTED_PROXIES environment variable.
  [cyberark/conjur#2168](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/2168)
- Added `conjurctl configuration show` command to print the Conjur configuration
  values and the sources they are loaded from.
  [cyberark/conjur#2169](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/2169)
- Added `conjurctl configuration apply` command restart the Conjur process and
  pick up changes to the configuration file.
  [cyberark/conjur#2171](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/2171)

### Fixed
- Fix bug where running `conjurctl server` or `conjurctl account create` with
  passwords that contain `,`s sent via stdin raised an error.
  [cyberark/conjur#2159](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/2159)
- Update the default keepalive timeout for puma to be longer than most common proxy and load balancers.
  Previously, the load balancer in front of Conjur would commonly have a longer timeout than the
  server itself, which can lead to Conjur closing connections even as there are pending requests and
  the proxy returning 502 errors to the client.
  [PR cyberark/conjur#2191](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/pull/2191)

### Security
- Upgrade Rails to 5.2.6 to resolve CVE-2021-22885

  [CVE-2020-36327](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-36327).

## [1.11.6] - 2021-04-28

### Fixed
- Fix bug where running `conjurctl server` or `conjurctl account create` with
  non-alpha-numeric passwords sent via stdin raised an error.
  [cyberark/conjur#2114](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/2114)

### Changed
- The batch secret retrieval endpoint now returns a 406 Not Acceptable instead
  of a 500 error when a secret with incompatible encoding is requested.
  [cyberark/conjur#2124](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/pull/2124)

### Security
- Upgrade github-pages in docs/Gemfile to resolve CVE-2021-28834 in kramdown dependency [cyberark/conjur#2099](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/2099)
- Bump `cyberark/ubi-ruby-fips` from 1.0.1 to 1.0.2 to address CVE-2021-20305.
  [cyberark/conjur#2120](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/2120)

### Added
- File `API_VERSION` containing the current Conjur API Version, which corresponds to a
  release of the [Conjur OpenAPI Spec](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur-openapi-spec).

- Status page details section now displays the Conjur API version.
  [cyberark/conjur#2130](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/2130)

## [1.11.5] - 2021-04-05

### Fixed
- Secrets batch request with blank variable names, now returns `Error 422
  Unprocessable Entity`.
  [cyberark/conjur#2083](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/2083)

### Added
- `conjurctl server` and `conjurctl account create` allow the operator to specify
  the admin user's password via STDIN by providing the `--password-from-stdin` switch.
  [cyberark/conjur#2043](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/2043)
- `conjurctl account create` now allows the operator to specify the account name via
  the `--name` flag. We recommend using this explicit flag when using the `--password-from-stdin`
  option so that commands are explicit and more readable.
  [cyberark/conjur#2043](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/2043)
- `/whoami` API endpoint now produces audit events.
  [cyberark/conjur#2052](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/2052)
- When a user checks permissions of a non-existing role or a non-existing resource,
  Conjur now audits a failure message.
  [cyberark/conjur#2059](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/2059)

### Changed
- The secrets batch retrieval endpoint now refers to the `Accept-Encoding`
  header rather than `Accept` to determine the response encoding.
  [cyberark/conjur#2065](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/pull/2065)
- When trying to fetch a missing or empty secret, a proper error message is now
  returned.
  [cyberark/conjur#2023](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/2023)
- Login and authentication error stack traces are printed to the log at the
  default INFO level. Previously, users had to restart their servers with
  `CONJUR_LOG_LEVEL=debug` to get meaningful log messages that diagnosed
  configuration or enablement errors; with this change, server logs will be
  clearer about login or authentication errors and will include minimal stack
  traces.
  [cyberark/conjur#2080](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/2080)
- Conjur base image updated to v1.0.1.
  [PR cyberark/conjur#2088](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/pull/2088)

## [1.11.4] - 2021-03-09

### Security
- Updated Rails to 5.2.4.5 to address CVE-2021-22880.
  [cyberark/conjur#2056](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/2056)

## [1.11.3] - 2021-02-22

### Fixed
- Conjur now raises a new `ServiceIdMissing` error if the `service-id` param is
  missing in an authentication request for the OIDC authenticator.
  [cyberark/conjur#2004](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/2004)

### Changed
- Conjur now raises a `RoleNotFound` error when trying to authenticate a
  non-existent host in authn-k8s.
  [cyberark/conjur#2046](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/2046)

## [1.11.2] - 2021-02-02
### Added
- New `edge`-tagged images are published to DockerHub on every master branch
  build.
  [cyberark/conjur#1617](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/1617)

### Changed
- Conjur images are updated to use pinned versions of the public base images.
  Users can now determine exactly which dependencies in the
  [Conjur Base Image](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur-base-image) project
  are included in their Conjur image.
  [cyberark/conjur#1974](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/1974)
- When [batch secret retrieval](https://docs.conjur.org/Latest/en/Content/Developer/Conjur_API_Batch_Retrieve.htm)
  requests are sent with an `Accept: base64` header, the secret values in
  the response will all be Base64-encoded. Sending requests with this header
  allows users to retrieve binary secrets encoded in Base64.
  [cyberark/conjur#1962](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/1962)
- Conjur now verifies that the `offset` parameter is a valid integer value.
  The `GET /resources` request will fail if `offset` is not an integer greater
  than or equal to 0.
  [cyberark/conjur#1997](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/1997)

### Fixed
- Requests with empty body and `application/json` Content-Type Header will now
  return 400 error instead of 500 error.
  [cyberark/conjur#1968](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/1968)
- Users no longer receive 500 errors when loading policy after performing
  database backup and restore.
  [cyberark/conjur#1948](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/1948)
- The audit endpoint no longer incorrectly reports a 404 Not Found response
  when the resource ID used for retrieving audit events includes a period (.).
  With this change, the audit endpoint is now consistent with how other Conjur
  endpoints handle unencoded periods in resource IDs.
  [cyberark/conjur#2001](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/2001)
- Attempts to retrieve binary secret data in a
  [batch secret retrieval request](https://docs.conjur.org/Latest/en/Content/Developer/Conjur_API_Batch_Retrieve.htm)
  without using the `Accept: base64` header now returns a message with the 500
  response to explain that improper secret encoding is the cause of the error.
  [cyberark/conjur#1962](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/1962)
- `GET /resources` request with non-numeric delimiter (limit or offset) now
  returns `Error 422 Unprocessable Entity` instead of `Error 500`.
  [cyberark/conjur#1997](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/1997)
- `POST /host_factory_tokens` request with invalid ip address or CIDR range of
  `cidr` parameter now returns `Error 422 Unprocessable Entity` instead of `Error 500`.
  [cyberark/conjur#2011](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/2011)

### Security
- Kubernetes authenticator certificate injection process now performs certificate
  verification to prevent MitM attacks.
  [Security Bulletin](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/security/advisories/GHSA-hvhv-f953-rwmv)

## [1.11.1] - 2020-11-19
### Added
- UBI-based Conjur image to support Conjur server running on OpenShift. Image
  will be published to RedHat Container Registry.
  [cyberark/conjur#1883](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/1883)

## [1.11.0] - 2020-11-06
### Added
- GCP authenticator (`authn-gcp`) supports authenticating from Google Cloud Function (GCF)
  using a GCE instance identity token.
  See [design](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/blob/master/design/authenticators/authn_gcp/authn_gcp_solution_design.md)
  for details. [cyberark/conjur#1804](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/1804)

### Changed
- Conjur now raises an ExecCommandError error instead of a CertInstallationError
  error in case it failed to install the client certificate during authn-k8s.
  [cyberark/conjur#1860](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/1860)

### Fixed
- Conjur now raises an Unauthorized error when a user attempts to rotate the API key of a
  nonexistent role. Previously, the operation would result in a successful rotation of the
  existing user's API key, with no indication that the target of the operation had changed.
  [cybeark/conjur#1914](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/1914)

### Security
- Bumped Ruby version from 2.5.1 to 2.5.8 to address
  [CVE-2020-10663](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-10663).
  [cyberark/conjur#1906](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/pull/1906)

## [1.10.0] - 2020-10-16
### Added
- [Documentation](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/blob/master/UPGRADING.md)
  explaining how to upgrade a Conjur server deployed in a Docker Compose environment.
  [cyberark/conjur#1528](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/1528), [cyberark/conjur#1584](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/1584)
- When Conjur starts, we now convert blank environment variables to nil. This ensures we treat empty environment values as
  if the environment variable is not present, rather than attempting to use the empty string value. [cyberark/conjur#1841](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/1841)

### Changed
- The "inject_client_cert" request now returns 202 Accepted instead of 200 OK to
  indicate that the cert injection has started but not necessarily completed.
  [cyberark/conjur#1848](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/1848)

### Fixed
- Conjur now verifies that Kubernetes Authenticator variables exist and have value before retrieving them so that a
  proper error will be raised if they aren't.
  [cyberark/conjur#1315](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/1315)

## [1.9.0] - 2020-08-31
### Added
- A new authenticator for applications running in Google Cloud Platform (`authn-gcp`),
  which supports authenticating from Google Compute Engines (GCE) using a GCE instance
  identity token. See [design](design/authenticators/authn_gcp/authn_gcp_solution_design.md)
  for details. [cyberark/conjur#1711](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/1711)
- New `/whoami` API endpoint for improved supportability and debugging for access
  tokens and client IP address determination. [cyberark/conjur#1697](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/1697)
- `TRUSTED_PROXIES` is validated at Conjur startup to ensure that it contains
  valid IP addresses and/or address ranges in CIDR notation.
  [cyberark/conjur#1727](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/1727)
- The `/authenticate` endpoint now returns a text/plain base64 encoded access token
  if the `Accept-Encoding` request header includes `base64`.
  [cyberark/conjur#151](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/151)

### Changed
- The "inject_client_cert" request now returns 202 Accepted instead of 200 OK to
  indicate that the cert injection has started but not necessarily completed.
  [cyberark/conjur#1848](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/1848)
- The Conjur server request logs now records the same IP address used by audit
  logs and network authentication filters with the `restricted_to` attribute.
  [cyberark/conjur#1719](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/1719)
- Conjur now only trusts `127.0.0.1` to send the `X-Forwarded-For` header by
  default. Additional trusted IP addresses may be added with the `TRUSTED_PROXIES`
  environment variable. [cyberark/conjur#1725](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/1725)
- Invalid CIDR notation in `restricted_to` now returns a policy validation
  error, rather than an internal server error.
  [cyberark/conjur#1763](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/1763)

### Fixed
- The `TRUSTED_PROXIES` environment variable now works correctly again after the
  Rails 5 upgrade. This is to indicate trusted proxy IP addresses when using the
  `X-Forwarded-For` HTTP header to identity the true client IP address of a request.
  [cyberark/conjur#1689](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/1689)
- A new database migration step updates the fingerprints in slosilo. The FIPS compliance
  update in `v1.8.0` caused the previous fingerprints to be invalid.
  [cyberark/conjur#1584](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/1584)

### Security
- Replaces string comparison with Secure Compare to prevent timing attacks against
  the API authentication endpoint. [Security Bulletin](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/security/advisories/GHSA-c7x2-6g4j-327p)
- Roles must use basic authentication to rotate their own API key, and can no longer
  rotate their API key using only an access token. [Security Bulletin](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/security/advisories/GHSA-qhjf-g9gm-64jq)

## [1.8.1] - 2020-07-14
### Fixed
- Log the OpenSSL FIPS mode after Rails is initialized for both OSS and DAP.
  [cyberark/conjur#1684](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/pull/1684)
- Bump `conjur-policy-parser` so `revoke (member)` and `deny (role)`
  can correctly utilize relative paths. [cyberark/conjur-policy-parser#23](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur-policy-parser/pull/23)

## [1.8.0] - 2020-07-10
### Changed
- Use OpenSSL 1.0.2u to support FIPS compliance.
  [cyberark/conjur#1527](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/1527)
- Conjur can be configured to run in FIPS compliant or Non-FIPS compliant mode depending on requirements.
  FIPS Compliant mode is slightly slower then non-FIPS compliant.
  [cyberark/conjur#1527](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/1527)
- Bump conjur-rack from 4.0.0 to 4.2.0 that consumes FIPS compliant slosilo.
  [cyberark/conjur#1527](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/1527)
- Print login and authentication error to the log in INFO level.
  [cyberark/conjur#1377](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/1377)
- Print proper message when user does not exist in authn or login request with
  default authenticator.
  [cyberark/conjur#1655](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/1655)

### Added
- Password changes (`PUT /authn/:account/password`) now produce audit events with
  message ID `password`. [cyberark/conjur#1548](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/1548)
- API key rotations (`PUT /:authenticator/:account/api_key`) now produce audit events with
  message ID `api-key`. [cyberark/conjur#1549](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/1549)
- All audit events now contain the IP address of the client that initiated the
  API request (e.g. `[client@43868 ip="172.24.0.5"]`).
  [cyberark/conjur#1550](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/1550)
- Print Conjur server FIPS mode status. [cyberark/conjur#1654](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/1654)

### Security
- Updated `rack` to `2.2.3` to resolve CVE-2020-8184. [cyberark/conjur#1643](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/pull/1643)

## [1.7.4] - 2020-06-17

### Fixed
- The default content type for requests is now set at the beginning of the
  Rack middleware chain, so that the content type is available for
  subsequent middleware ([cyberark/conjur#1622](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/1622))
- The default content type middleware now correctly checks for the
  absence of the `Content-Type` header
  ([cyberark/conjur#1622](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/1622))

## [1.7.3] - 2020-06-11

### Fixed
- Host Factory Host creation no longer makes unecessary database queries, causing
  performance issues with large numbers of created hosts
  ([cyberark/conjur#1605](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/1605))

## [1.7.2] - 2020-06-08

### Fixed
- The Conjur version is now printed on server startup, after running `conjurctl server`
  ([cyberark/conjur#1590](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/pull/1590))
- Raise proper error of an authn request with a non-existing user to the `authn`
  authenticator ([cyberark/conjur#1591](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/pull/1591))

## [1.7.1] - 2020-06-03

### Added
- Print version on server startup ([cyberark/conjur#1531](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/1531))

### Fixed
- `rake policy:load` fails when loading policy ([cyberark/conjur#1581](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/1581))

## [1.7.0] - 2020-05-29

### Fixed
- The k8s authenticator correctly authenticates an app using the host ID to specify
  the k8s resource constraints and an annotation to specify the authenticator
  container name using the "authn-k8s" prefix ([cyberark/conjur#1535](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/1535), [conjurinc/dap-support#79](https://github.com/conjurinc/dap-support/issues/79)) - [PR](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/pull/1499).
- Fixed exception in `conjurctl` when loading policy ([conjurinc/dap-support#80](https://github.com/conjurinc/dap-support/issues/80)) - [PR](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/pull/1510).

- Policy load API endpoints now default to the `application/x-yaml` content-type if no content type is provided in the request ([conjurinc/dap-support#74](https://github.com/conjurinc/dap-support/issues/74)) - [PR](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/pull/1505).
- ActiveSupport uses SHA1 instead of MD5 ([cyberark/conjur#1418](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/1418)).
- Authentication audit events now use separate operations for `authenticate`,
  `login`, and `validate-status` workflows
  ([cyberark/conjur#1054](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/1054)).
- Authentication workflow checks origin before credentials to insure a request can authenticate before authenticating ([cyberark/conjur#1568](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/1568)).

### Added
- The Kubernetes authentication `/inject-client-cert` endpoint now generates
  an authentication audit event with the `k8s-inject-client-cert` operation
  ([cyberark/conjur#1538](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/1538)).
- Adds a `CertMissingCNEntry` error to improve visibility of Kubernetes authenticator failures ([cyberark/conjur#1278](cyberark/conjur/issues/1278)).
- Logs the authenticator used when the `authentication-container-name` annotation is missing ([conjurinc/dap-support#69](https://github.com/conjurinc/dap-support/issues/69)) - [PR](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/pull/1526).

### Fixed
- Status page details section now displays the Conjur version number
  [cyberark/conjur#1438](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/1438).

## [1.5.0] - 2020-03-23

### Added
- Hosts can authenticate from Azure VMs using an Azure access token. See
  [design](design/authenticators/authn_azure/authn_azure_solution_design.md) for details
  ([conjurinc/appliance#927](https://github.com/conjurinc/appliance/issues/927)).

### Changed
- Lock rotators to prevent multiple rotations from incurring simultaneously.

### Fixed
- Fix support for using deployment as K8s authentication resource type for Kubernetes >= 1.16
  ([#1440](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/1440))

### Fixed
- Updated broken links on server status page (#1341)

## [1.4.6] - 2020-01-21

### Changed

### Added
- Added API endpoint to enable and disable authenticators. See
  [design/authenticator_whitelist_api.md](design/authenticators/authenticator_whitelist_api.md)
  for details.

### Changed
- The k8s host id does not use the "{@account}:host:conjur/authn-k8s/#{@service_name}/apps"
  prefix and takes the full host-id from the CSR. We also handle backwards-compatibility and use
  the prefix in case of an older client.

## [1.4.4] - 2019-12-19

### Added
- Early validation of account existence during OIDC authentication
- Code coverage reporting and collection

### Changed

  longer cause the k8s authenticator to fail with `undefined method` ([#1182](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/1182)).

## [1.4.1] - 2019-06-24
### Fixed
- Make sure the authentication framework only caches Role lookups for the
  duration of a single request. Reusing stale lookups was leading to
  authentication failures.

## [1.4.0] - 2019-04-23
### Added
- Kubernetes authentication can now work externally from Kubernetes

### Changed
- Moved changelog validation up in CI pipeline

  exists but there is no corresponding `Resource` record.
- Improved authenticator error handling and logging.

## [1.3.0] - 2018-10-10
### Fixed

  Conjur services. More details are available [here](design/CERTIFICATE_SIGNING.md).
- Added support for Conjur CAs to use encrypted private keys
- Implemented keyword search for Role memberships
- Update Conjur issued certificates to include a SPIFFE SVID as a subject alternative
  name (SAN).

### Changed
- Change authn-k8s to expect the client cert (passed in `X-SSL-Client-Certificate`) to be
  url-escaped.

### Fixed
- Substantial performance improvement when loading large policy files

### Security
- Fixes a vulnerability that could allow an authn-K8s request to bypass mutual TLS authentication. All Conjur users using authn-k8s within Kubernetes or OpenShift are strongly recommended to upgrade to this version.
