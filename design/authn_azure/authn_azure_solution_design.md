## Issue description

Many of our customers are using Azure as their main cloud provider. Therefore we want to enable Azure resources to authenticate according to Azure 
properties and get back a Conjur access token in order to retrieve secrets from our providers. At current, customers can authenticate their Azure 
VMs with Conjur by creating a Conjur host identity for their Azure resources. The Azure resource would then receive an API key as part of the 
creation of a Conjur identity which they must use to connect to targets. This is not optimal nor convenient because we are not allowing the 
resources to authenticate based on their Azure identity and demand that the resource hold an extra secret, the Conjur-given API key.

## Solution

We will add a new authenticator to Conjur, which users can authenticate with from Azure VMs. As mentioned in the [feature doc](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/appliance-development-5c9cf04bfa1c204b63eddcc6/issues/cyberark/conjur/1266), before any authentication 
request is sent to Conjur, the admin will load the authenticator policy: 

```yaml
# policy id needs to match the convention `conjur/authn-azure/<service ID>`
- !policy
  id: conjur/authn-azure/prod
  body:
  - !webservice

  - !variable
    id: provider-uri  
      
  - !group apps
  
  - !permit
    role: !group apps
    privilege: [ read, authenticate ]
    resource: !webservice
```

and add the `provider-uri` variable to the webservice (e.g `https://sts.windows.net/TENANT_ID`). 

As part of our effort to improve the user experience for our authenticators, we discussed two options for defining the `provider-uri`:
 
1. `provider-uri` as a variable
    ```yaml
    - !policy
      id: conjur/authn-azure/prod
      body:
      - !webservice
    
      - !variable
        id: provider-uri      
    ```
    
1. `provider-uri` as an entry in the webservice annotations
    ```yaml
    - !policy
      id: conjur/authn-azure/prod
      body:
        - !webservice
          annotations: 
            provider-uri: https://sts.windows.net/TENANT_ID
          
    ```     

Because the `provider-uri` doesn't hold sensitive information, it doesn't necessary need to be saved as a secret in Conjur. Adding the `provider-uri` as a variable in the policy demands later that the
admin user populate its value through the CLI. Further, adding it as annotation entry makes it easier to set it as a key-value pair and is therefore more readable. 
On the other hand, with `provider-uri` in the host annotations, any change to this value will demand a complete replacement of the root policy which raises concerns for maintenance. 
For concerns of maintenance and for uniformity preservation across our different authenticators, we have decided against moving the `provider-uri` to the webservice annotation.
 
### Azure Application Identity

To authenticate with Conjur, Azure-specific fields will need to be provided in the host annotations of the Conjur host identity for the Azure resource- subscription-id, resource-group, and user/system-assigned-identity. Specifically, If the Azure resource is assigned a system-assigned-identity, 
we will also need to validate the `oid` field of the Azure access token. These fields will be used to confirm the identity of the Azure resource that is
sending the authentication request. This will be done by comparing the Azure access token information with the host annotations that are defined in the policy below.

A Conjur host will be defined as follows with their annotations holding Azure-specific identification properties.

```yaml
- !policy 
  id: azure-apps 
  body: 
  - !host 
    id: test-app 
    annotations: 
      authn-azure/subscription-id: test-subscription 
      authn-azure/resource-group: test-group 
      authn-azure/user-assigned-identity: test-app-pipeline 
OR 
      authn-azure/system-assigned-identity: 853b9a84-5bfa-4b22-a3f3-0b9a43d9ad8a

- !grant
  role: !group conjur/authn-azure/prod/apps
  member: !host azure-apps/test-app
```

#### Supported granularity

1. Subscription ID + Resource Group

1. Subscription ID + Resource Group + System Assigned Identity

1. Subscription ID + Resource Group + User Assigned Identity

We do not support a combination of System Assigned Identity & User Assigned Identity

#### Multiple-assigned identity for host - NOT FOR NOW

We may allow hosts to be defined with both "authn-azure/user-assigned-identity" and "authn-azure/system-assigned-identity". This way such a host can 
authenticate a token with a user-assigned id as well as a token with a system-assigned id. As a first step we will not develop - nor test - such a use-case.

### Design

#### Authentication Flow

This flow assumes that the VM already exists in Azure, and that an authn-azure authenticator and a Conjur host were loaded.

![Authn Azure Flow](authn-azure-flow.png)


1. Azure VM sends the following request to Conjur:
   
    ```yaml
    POST https://<conjur-server-hostname>/authn-azure/<service-id>/<account>/<host-id>/authenticate
    
    Header 
     Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
    
    Body 
     jwt: "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIs......uTonCA"
    ```

1. An already existing route will be used (post '/:authenticator(/:service_id)/:account/:id/authenticate' => 'authenticate#authenticate') that will forward the request to the AuthenticationController. 

1. The request will then be forwarded to the Authentication::Authenticate CommandClass. This CommandClass holds a collection of general authenticator validations that will take place.

1. The two first general validations include validate_authenticator_exists and validate_security. 
    
    1. validate_authenticator_exists ensures that the authenticator sent as part of the request URI is one that we support (authn-k8s, authn-azure, etc.).

    1. validate_security validates that the Azure authenticator has been defined correctly in policy and the host is permitted to authenticate to the webservice.

1. The next validation, validate_credentials calls the authenticator's `valid?` function. Then, Azure-specific authenticator validations will be triggered. 

    1. validate_azure_token (see below for a more detailed explanation of the function).
    
    1. validate_application_identity - the annotations of the authenticating host and the properties extracted from the "xms_mirid" field of the Azure token provided by the Azure VM are compared (see below for a more detailed explanation of the function).

1. Once the Azure authenticator-specific validations have passed, the general authenticator validations can continue.
   
    1. validate_origin checks the origin of the request to determine if the origin of the request is restricted.

1. If all validations pass, an audit entry is written to audit logs and a Conjur access token will be returned to the Azure requesting resource. This Conjur access token will be used for all further communications between the Azure resource and Conjur.

If at any point a validation fails, an audit entry is written to audit logs and an error response is returned to the client.

### Azure authenticator class
 
As mentioned in the flow above, we will create a new CommandClass for Azure-specific validations.

 ```ruby
require 'command_class'

module Authentication
  module AuthnAzure

    Err = Errors::Authentication::AuthnAzure

    Authenticator = CommandClass.new(
      dependencies: {
       ...
      },
      inputs: [:authenticator_input]
    ) do
      
	  # Azure authenticator checks
      def call
        validate_azure_token
        validate_application_identity
      end

      private

      ...

    end
 ```


#### validate_azure_token

The Azure token validation checks the signature and claims of the Azure token to 
ensure that the token was issued by the Azure Active Directory defined in the authenticator policy. 
To do this we need to:
1. Discover the Oauth 2.0 provider - in this case the Azure AD is the Oauth 2.0 
provider. Its URl will be retrieved from the "provider-uri" variable value defined in the authenticator policy
1. Retrieve JWKs from the discovery endpoint - These keys are used for the token validation
1. Decode and verify the token using the JWKs.

Steps 1 & 2 may seem familiar as they are the exact steps that we perform in the 
OIDC Authenticator. This is because OIDC is Oauth 2.0 based. We will take advantage 
on this and use the 3rd party used in the OIDC Authenticator to perform steps 
1 & 2 in our authenticator.

Unfortunately, the 3rd party used in the OIDC Authenticator does not implement 
an access token decoding, and only an ID Token decoding. Thus, to perform step 3, we will need another 3rd 
party - the ["jwt" gem](https://github.com/jwt/ruby-jwt). This gem has an MIT License which is aligned with our policy.

As you can see in the following blueprint for the `validate_azure_token` 
implementation, it will use `AuthnOidc`'s `FetchProviderCertificate` class to 
retrieve the JWKs and will use them to verify & decode the token, using `JWT`'s `decode` function:
```
require 'jwt'

module Authentication
  module AuthnAzure
    DecodeAndVerifyToken = CommandClass.new(
      dependencies: {
        # We have a ConcurrencyLimitedCache which wraps a RateLimitedCache which wraps a FetchProviderCertificate class
        fetch_provider_certificate: ::Util::ConcurrencyLimitedCache.new(
          ::Util::RateLimitedCache.new(
            ::Authentication::AuthnOidc::FetchProviderCertificate.new,
            refreshes_per_interval: 10,
            rate_limit_interval:    300, # 300 seconds (every 5 mins)
            logger: Rails.logger
          ),
          max_concurrent_requests: 3,
          logger: Rails.logger
        ),
      },
      inputs:       %i(provider_uri token_jwt)
    ) do

      def call
        certs = @fetch_provider_certificate.(
          provider_uri: @provider_uri
        )     

        # indicate that we should verify the issuer and audience claims
        options = { iss: provider_uri, verify_iss: true, verify_aud: true }

        @decoded_token = JWT.decode(
          @token_jwt,
          @certs, # JWKs retrieved from the provider
          true, # tells the decoder to verify the token
          options
        )
      end
    end
  end
end
```

Note that `JWT.decode` not only decodes the token but also validates it. It gets as
input the JWKs retrieved from the provider and validates the signature of the token.
It also validates the `iss` claim to verify that the token was issued by the correct
Azure provider (which is the Oauth 2.0 provider).
 
#### validate_application_identity

The `validate_application_identity` function will validate that the Azure VM can 
authenticate with Conjur based on information extracted from the provided Azure token.

Proposed validation flow is as followings:

![Assigned Identity Flow](assigned-identity-flow.png)

1. We will extract the `xms_mirid` field from the Azure access token

1. If the `xms_mirid` field exists, we will parse it and extract the 
`resource_group` and `subscription_id` and compare them with their equivalents 
in the Conjur host. If the field does not exist, we will raise a proper error.

    *NOTE:* It is required that the Host annotation have at least `authn-azure/subscription-id` and `authn-azure/resource-group` but
    for greater security granularity, a third host annotation can exist - `authn-azure/system-assigned-identity` or `authn-azure/user-assigned-identity`. 

1. If a third annotation, `authn-azure/system-assigned-identity` or `authn-azure/user-assigned-identity` is present, the process of 
validating this annotation entry differs depending on the identity assigned to the Azure resource. 
Because of this, we need to handle each case differently. The two types of identities that can be assigned to an Azure resource include the following:

    1. system-assigned identity

    1. user-assigned identity

1. As you can see in the "Examples" section below, the suffix of the `xms_mirid` field includes
the assigned identity. If the suffix includes `Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/<user_assigned_identity>`
then it is a user assigned identity. In this case we will compare its value (i.e `<user_assigned_identity>`) 
with the `authn-azure/user-assigned-identity` annotation defined in the Conjur host.

1. Otherwise, we will check if `providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/` is present in the `xms_mirid` claim. 
If so, we will compare the `oid` field from the Azure access token with the 
`authn-azure/user-assigned-identity` annotation in the Conjur host.
    Note: At this point we support only VMs. In the future we can check for other Azure resources in the `xms_mirid` suffix.
  

##### Examples

Let's take a look at examples for tokens with a system-assigned identity and token with a user-assigned identity.

###### system-assigned identity

```yaml
{
  "aud": "https://management.azure.com/",
  "iss": "https://sts.windows.net/df242c82.../",
  "iat": 157...,
  "nbf": 157...,
  "exp": 157...,
  "aio": "42Vg...",
  "appid": "7230cc60...",
  "appidacr": "2",
  "idp": "https://sts.windows.net/df242c82...",
  "oid": "14751f4a...",
  "sub": "14751f4a...",
  "tid": "df242c82...",
  "uti": "g1mKQ0DE...",
  "ver": "1.0",
  "xms_mirid": "/subscriptions/<subscription_id>/resourcegroups/<resource_group>/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/<resource_name>"
}
```

The following is a mapping of Host annotations with the values we will be extracting in the Azure access token for `system-assigned-identities` 

| Host annotation                                                      | Azure access token             | 
|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| `authn-azure/subscription-id`                                        | subscription_id (inside `xms_mirid`)  |
| `authn-azure/resource-group`                                         | resource_group (inside `xms_mirid`)   |
| `authn-azure/system-assigned-identity`                               | `oid` field (Azure token)      |

###### user-assigned identity

```yaml
{
  "aud": "https://management.azure.com/",
  "iss": "https://sts.windows.net/df242c82.../",
  "iat": 157...,
  "nbf": 157...,
  "exp": 157...,
  "aio": "42Vg...",
  "appid": "7230cc60...",
  "appidacr": "2",
  "idp": "https://sts.windows.net/df242c82...",
  "oid": "14751f4a...",
  "sub": "14751f4a...",
  "tid": "df242c82...",
  "uti": "g1mKQ0DE...",
  "ver": "1.0",
  "xms_mirid": "/subscriptions/<subscription_id>/resourceGroups/<resource_group>/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/<resource_name>"
}
```

The following is a mapping of Host annotations with the values we will be extracting in the Azure access token for `user-assigned-identities`

| Host annotation                                                      | Azure access token             | 
|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| `authn-azure/subscription-id`                                        | subscription_id (inside `xms_mirid`)  |
| `authn-azure/resource-group`                                         | resource_group (inside `xms_mirid`)   |
| `authn-azure/user-assigned-identity`                                 | resource_name (inside `xms_mirid`)| 

Regardless of the assigned-identity for the Azure resource, once the proper fields are extracted from the Azure token, we will compare them to the annotations of the Conjur host for this Azure resource. If they match, the next validation test will run. If all 
validations run without raising an error, the Azure VM resource will receive a Conjur access token in return. All further requests that this Azure VM sends will need to have this Conjur access token in the header.

### Backwards compatibility

None because this is a new feature.

### Performance

Azure authenticator performance should conform with our other authenticators with an average call time of 1 second.

### Affected Components

- Conjur

- DAP

## Test Plan

### Integration tests

This suite of tests assumes that the Azure authenticator has been configured correctly

### Unit tests

1. Validate that `validate_azure_token` properly decodes the of JWT token

1. Validate that `validate_application_identity` accurately compares the Conjur host identity and Azure token correctly

1. If `validate_azure_token` or `validate_application_identity` raise an error then it propagates to calling `Authentication::Authenticate` class

## Open questions

- Do we want to develop a mechanism to support a request body with more than one field (currently, we have only "token", but we may want to add more fields later).

## Future efforts

- Challenge moving the `provider-uri` to the webservice annotations in terms of maintenance and evaluate the effort needed to cascade this update to our other authenticators (OIDC, K8s, etc)
    - How often does this value change?
    - How will it impact the OIDC authenticator experience?
