## Issue description
[//]: # (Elaborate on the issue you are writing a solution for)

## Solution
[//]: # (Elaborate on the solution you are suggesting in this page. Address the functional requirements and the non functional requirements that this solution is addressing. If there are a few options considered for the solution, mention them and explain why the actual solution was chosen over them. Add an execution plan when relevant. It doesn't have to be a full breakdown of the feature, but just a recommendation to how the solution should be approached.)

### Design
[//]: # (Add any diagrams, charts and explanations about the design aspect of the solution. Elaborate also about the expected user experience for the feature)

### Backwards compatibility
[//]: # (Address how you are going to handle backwards compatibility, if necessary)

### Performance
[//]: # (Elaborate on whether your solution will affect the product's performance, and how)

### Affected Components
[//]: # (Address the components that will be affected by your solution [Conjur, DAP, clients, integrations, etc.])

## Security
[//]: # (Are there any security issues with your solution? Even if you mentioned them somewhere in the doc it may be convenient for the security architect review to have them centralized here)

## Test Plan
[//]: # (Fill in the table below to depict the tests that should run to validate your solution)

### Audit 
[//]: # (Does this solution require additional audit messages?)

## Documentation
[//]: # (Add notes on what should be documented in this solution. Elaborate on where this should be documented. If the change is in open-source projects, we may need to update the docs in github too. If it's in Conjur and/or DAP mention which products are affected by it)

## Open questions
[//]: # (Add any question that is still open. It makes it easier for the reader to have the open questions accumulated here istead of them being acattered along the doc)

## Implementation plan
[//]: # (Break the solution into tasks)
